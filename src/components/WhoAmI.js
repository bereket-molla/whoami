            <p>I was born and raised in Ethiopia ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¹ where I had the most enjoyable time in my life. My love for computer science began in 2016 , when I had a humble introduction to programming through visual basics. At the time, I thought programming was some magic incantation. However, over the past years I
            came to realize that computer science is a world full of math and questions. A world worth digging deep into!</p>
